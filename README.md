This Python program utilizes tkinter, a graphical user interface library, to replicate the functions of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). The core functionality is organized into classes, including Account, TransactionHistory, Withdraw, Deposit, Transfer, and ATMApp. The Account class manages user accounts, storing user IDs, PINs, balances, and transaction histories. TransactionHistory provides a method to display transaction records. Withdraw, Deposit, and Transfer classes handle the corresponding financial transactions, adjusting account balances and recording transactions appropriately. The ATMApp class serves as the main orchestrator, facilitating GUI interactions, user authentication, option display, and transaction execution.

Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a login window where they can input their user ID and PIN. If the user is new, a new account is created. Upon successful authentication, users gain access to a range of ATM functionalities presented in the application window. They can view transaction history, make withdrawals, deposits, and transfer funds between accounts. Each operation triggers feedback messages informing users of the outcome. Additionally, users have the option to gracefully exit the application, ensuring a seamless user experience. Overall, this program streamlines the management of basic banking operations within a simulated ATM interface, promoting ease of use and accessibility for users.
