The ATMs in our cities are built on Python, as we have all seen them. It is a console-based application with five different classes. In order to use the system, the user must enter his or her user ID and pin when it starts. Once the details are entered successfully, ATM functionality is unlocked. As a result of the project, the following operations can be performed:

-Transactions History
-Withdraw
-Deposit
-Transfer
-Quit

-->The project aims to develop a console-based ATM application using Python, featuring five distinct classes to manage various functionalities. Users are required to input their user ID and PIN upon starting the application to gain access to ATM operations. Once authenticated successfully, users can leverage the system to execute a range of banking transactions seamlessly. The application's primary functionalities include accessing transaction history, withdrawing funds, depositing funds, transferring funds between accounts, and gracefully exiting the application.

One of the key features of the ATM application is the ability to retrieve transaction history, allowing users to review their past financial activities. This feature provides users with a comprehensive overview of their account transactions, enabling them to track their spending and monitor their financial status effectively. By accessing their transaction history, users can identify patterns, reconcile discrepancies, and make informed financial decisions.

Another essential functionality of the ATM application is the option to withdraw funds from the user's account. Users can specify the desired amount to withdraw, and the system will deduct the corresponding funds from their account balance. This operation is crucial for users needing immediate access to cash and ensures convenience and accessibility when managing their finances.

Additionally, the ATM application supports deposit transactions, enabling users to add funds to their accounts effortlessly. Users can input the amount they wish to deposit, and the system will update their account balance accordingly. This feature facilitates the process of adding funds to accounts, whether through cash deposits or transfers from other sources, enhancing the flexibility and utility of the application for users. Lastly, the application includes a transfer functionality, allowing users to transfer funds between accounts. This operation facilitates seamless fund transfers between users, providing a convenient method for conducting financial transactions securely. Overall, the ATM application offers a user-friendly and efficient platform for managing banking activities, empowering users to conduct transactions conveniently and securely from the comfort of their homes or on-the-go.
